One Night Werewolf PnP
======================

A minimalist take on the popular one night variation of werewolf. Cards provide info about the roles, wake info and their allegiances.

Based on a previous PnP for [2R1B](https://github.com/fergul/2R1B_PnP) I created and a great stackoverflow [post](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/185830) for latex card design.

There are 2 pdf versions available, one with backs and one without. In hindsight, the current asymmetrical back design ([Wolf](https://thenounproject.com/term/wolf/16473/) by Lee Mette from the Noun Project) makes it easier to notice if your card has been messed with, hence the blank version - bonus, there's no alignment issues when printing back/front using no duplex home printers.


Custom versions
---------------

Feel free to clone and create your own versions, with some of the other possible roles to create the ultimate version. 

Because of the back design you will need to use xelatex - but if you get rid of it and the pstricks include it should compile using pdflatex.
